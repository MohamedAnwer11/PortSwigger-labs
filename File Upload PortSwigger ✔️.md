## 1. Lab: Remote code execution via web shell upload

**Instructions:**
This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the fileÂ `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:Â `wiener:peter`

**Solution:**

Once you enter this lab you have the credentials with username : wiener  |  password : peter
and the you have the file upload vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem

![[1.png]]
for this you can try to upload file that content the shell you can create this 

```PHP
<?php 
$output = shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]);
echo "<pre>$output</pre>";
?>
```

![[2.png]]
uploaded Successfully
this small code open the shell on the server and you can write the any command on the server.

![[4.png]]
Now get the path for the image you uploaded 
Follow this with the ?cmd=id to get userId

## 2. Lab: Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass

**Instructions:**
This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the fileÂ `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:Â `wiener:peter`

**Solution:**
Once you enter this lab you have the credentials with username : wiener  |  password : peter
and the you have the file upload but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this
for this you can try to upload file that content the shell you can create this

![[Pasted image 20251017232527.png]]

This not accept because it more secure ðŸ˜‚
it tell you that type application/x-php not accept the file that you uploaded
the type image/png and type image/jpeg accept this 
Now change the type and send the request.

![[Pasted image 20251017234415.png]]
and it uploaded successfully 
Check if the shell work or not by write and command like `cmd=id`
![[Pasted image 20251017234532.png]]

Now the Target to get the path of the `/home/carlos/secret` you can make this if this file on your machine with use command `cat /home/carlos/secret`.

## 3. Lab: Web shell upload via path traversal

**Instructions:**
This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. The server is configured to prevent execution of user-supplied files, but this restriction can be bypassed by exploiting aÂ [secondary vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal).

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the fileÂ `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:Â `wiener:peter`


**Solution:**
Once you enter this lab you have the credentials with username : wiener  |  password : peter
The server is configured to prevent execution of user-supplied files, but this restriction can be bypassed by exploiting


![[1.png]]
you can upload the shell.php that have the exploit code 
![[Pasted image 20251017235909.png]]
It uploaded successfully but i have a problem
when i get the path for this shell file it show the content for the image as a text

![[Pasted image 20251017235748.png]]
you can try to use file traversal to solve this problem
you can add the `../` before the name of your upload file and don't forget to decode this with URL encoding to bypass this to get the file name `%2e%2e%2fshell.php`
![[Pasted image 20251018000549.png]]

and the file upload successfully now you want to test the shell script 
![[Pasted image 20251018000815.png]]
Now the Target to get the path of the `/home/carlos/secret` you can make this if this file on your machine with use command `cat /home/carlos/secret`.
![[Pasted image 20251018000928.png]]
Congratulations, You got the flagðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

## 4. Lab: Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass

**Instructions:**
This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed due to a fundamental flaw in the configuration of this blacklist.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the fileÂ `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:Â `wiener:peter`

**Solution:**
Once you enter this lab you have the credentials with username : wiener  |  password : peter
Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed due to a fundamental flaw in the configuration of this blacklist.

![[1.png]]

I tried to upload my shell shell.php put it not allowed to upload this 

![[Pasted image 20251018011008.png]]

you can try another version of php (e.g php5, php7,phtml) and it successfully uploaded put it show it as an Image

![[Pasted image 20251018010910.png]]

you can use another thing called `.htaccess ` to understand this 
you make the Small Game ðŸŽ® you will upload Two files 
First one file name `.htaccess` and the content to allow to any file with `.l33t` 

![[Pasted image 20251018012859.png]]

and The Second file that file name `file.l33t` that content the PHP code inside it

![[Pasted image 20251018012642.png]]

and the file that content the shell code will uploaded successfully

![[Pasted image 20251018012602.png]]

to test the shell script that you have cmd you can test `?cmd=id`

![[Pasted image 20251018012534.png]]

Now the Target to get the path of the `/home/carlos/secret` you can make this if this file on your machine with use command `cat /home/carlos/secret`.

## 6. Lab: Remote code execution via polyglot web shell upload

**Instructions:**
This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Although it checks the contents of the file to verify that it is a genuine image, it is still possible to upload and execute server-side code.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the fileÂ `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:Â `wiener:peter`


**Solution:**

Once you enter this lab you have the credentials with username : wiener  |  password : peter
this lab has vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed using a classic obfuscation technique.

![[1.png]]
you can upload the file that content the shell in the upload field and this not allowed because it check the content of the shell script i can use the **polyglot web shell**

TheÂ **polyglot web shell**Â technique works by creating a file that is both a valid image and a functional PHP script. The server accepts it because it validates the file as a legitimate image (based on structure or magic bytes), but when accessed, the PHP interpreter processes embedded code in the imageâ€™s metadata

to understand this if you have an image called "Me.jpg" you can use tool called **exifable** to get the information for this image.
![[Pasted image 20251018024350.png]]

this tool has the option that you can add the comment to this image 
`exiftool -Comment="Write anything you like" Me.jpg`

![[Pasted image 20251018024503.png]]

Now show the Information of the image again you can see this comment on the image.

![[Pasted image 20251018024545.png]]

Idea that you can use that you can put the payload on the comment with this tool and the output for this put it file called `polyglot.php`

![[Pasted image 20251018024706.png]]
and upload this file to the server

![[Pasted image 20251018023736.png]]

it will successfully uploaded and show to you the content that you want to show 

![[Pasted image 20251018023718.png]]

Congratulations, You got the FlagðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.
